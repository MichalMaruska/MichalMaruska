- 👋 Hi, I’m @MichalMaruska
- I maintain a ["double" keyboard driver](https://github.com/MichalMaruska/fork-plugin/) for Xorg, Weston and Windows 10+
- I have some extensions to other projects, and have a tool to keep a [git-hierarchy](https://maruska7.blogspot.com/2012/11/git-hierarchy-how-to-use.html) of these extensions. Implemented first in [shell](https://github.com/MichalMaruska/git-hierarchy), then [GoLang](https://github.com/MichalMaruska/git-hierarchy-go), and [Rust](https://github.com/MichalMaruska/git-hierarchy-rust), based on libgit2
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Scheme language (gauche, chez, scsh...)
- But I can code professionally in Rust, C++, GoLang, Kotlin, Java, Python, Shell
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... OpenCV
- 💞️ other interests: math
- I'm looking for a  (remote) job
